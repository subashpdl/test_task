# test_task
For this task, I've created a function that automatically downloads all Parquet files from the year 2024 and beyond. Additionally, another function appends all monthly files of each year and generates a combined file, resembling a process of data integration.
Furthermore, I utilized the combined file to compute the average length of trips for each month and implemented a rolling average calculation.
To streamline the process, I've built a Docker image and set up a CI/CD pipeline. Below are the instructions to run the code:

1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/subashpdl/test_task.git
2. Install Requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Code: python main.py
